## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

This project is built with Vite and is configured for seamless deployment to Netlify and Cloudflare Pages.

### Deploying to Netlify

This repository includes a `netlify.toml` file, which automatically configures the build settings for you.

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   A Netlify account.
    *   Your project pushed to a GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket repository.

2.  **Steps**:
    *   Log in to your Netlify dashboard.
    *   Click **"Add new site"** -> **"Import an existing project"**.
    *   Connect to your Git provider and select your repository.
    *   Netlify will read the `netlify.toml` file and automatically set the **Build command** to `yarn build` and the **Publish directory** to `dist`. You don't need to change anything.
    *   **Crucially**, you must add your environment variables. Go to **"Site settings"** -> **"Build & deploy"** -> **"Environment"**. Add your Supabase credentials:
        *   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: `YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`
        *   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
    *   Click **"Deploy site"**. Netlify will now build and deploy your project correctly.

### Deploying to Cloudflare Pages

1.  **Prerequisites**:
    *   A Cloudflare account.
    *   Your project pushed to a GitHub or GitLab repository.

2.  **Steps**:

        *   **Build output directory**: `dist`
    *   Click **"Save and Deploy"**.
    *   After the first deployment, go to your new site's settings -> **"Environment Variables"** and add your Supabase credentials for both "Production" and "Preview" environments:
        *   `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: `YOUR_SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL`
        *   `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: `YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`
